## Why Dual Licensing?

UTL-X uses dual licensing to achieve two complementary goals:

### 1. Open Source (AGPL-3.0)
- Keep the **entire codebase open and free**
- Benefit individuals, students, researchers
- Support open-source projects and communities
- Enable companies that can comply with AGPL requirements

### 2. Commercial License
- Enable companies that **cannot comply with AGPL** to use UTL-X in proprietary software
- Allow embedding in commercial closed-source products
- Support SaaS products without requiring source code disclosure
- Generate revenue to sustain full-time development

### This Model Ensures:

✅ **All code remains open source forever** - No "enterprise-only" features  
✅ **Sustainable development** - Commercial revenue funds full-time developers  
✅ **Community benefits** - Your contributions help both open source and commercial users  
✅ **Fair compensation** - Glomidco B.V. can pay contributors and maintainers  
✅ **No vendor lock-in** - Open source version always available under AGPL  
✅ **Transparent governance** - Clear rules for how contributions are used

### Your Contributions:

- Will **always** be available under AGPL-3.0 (open source)
- Will **also** be available under commercial licenses to customers who purchase them
- Benefit the **entire community** (open source users and commercial users)
- Help make UTL-X **sustainable** and actively maintained
- Enable the project to hire full-time developers
- Support long-term maintenance and security updates

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Do I lose copyright to my Contributions?

**A:** No! You retain full copyright ownership. You're only granting Glomidco B.V. a license to use your Contributions in the UTL-X project. You can still use your code anywhere else.

### Q: Can I use my Contributions in other projects?

**A:** Yes! You can use your own code in any project you want, under any license. You're not giving up any rights to your own work.

### Q: Why does Glomidco need commercial licensing rights?

**A:** Many companies cannot use AGPL-licensed software in proprietary products due to the copyleft requirements. Commercial licensing allows them to use UTL-X legally while providing revenue to sustain development, pay developers, and maintain the project long-term.

### Q: Will my Contributions always be open source?

**A:** Yes! Your Contributions will **always** be available under AGPL-3.0. Dual licensing means they're available under both AGPL (open source) and commercial licenses - but the open source version never goes away.

### Q: What if I contribute code from someone else?

**A:** Don't! Only contribute code you wrote yourself, or code that's openly licensed (and properly attributed). If you're unsure, ask first in the issue or discussion.

### Q: What if my employer owns my code?

**A:** Then your employer needs to sign a Corporate CLA. Contact cla@glomidco.com to get the process started. It's straightforward and usually takes just a few days.

### Q: Can I revoke this agreement later?

**A:** No. The licenses you grant are perpetual and irrevocable. This ensures that Glomidco B.V., other contributors, and users of UTL-X can continue using your Contributions indefinitely. However, you retain your copyright and can still use your code elsewhere.

### Q: What if I contribute and then leave the project?

**A:** Your Contributions remain licensed under the terms of this CLA. The project can continue using them. You're not obligated to maintain or support your contributions after you leave.

### Q: Is this a standard CLA?

**A:** Yes! This CLA is modeled after industry-standard CLAs from Apache, Eclipse, Python, and other major open source projects. The only difference is we're transparent about dual licensing.

### Q: What happens to my contributions if Glomidco B.V. is sold?

**A:** Your contributions remain under AGPL-3.0 (open source) forever. The new owner would inherit the commercial licensing rights, but cannot remove the open source license. The community always has access to the code.

### Q: Do I need to sign again for each contribution?

**A:** No! You sign once, and it covers all your future contributions to UTL-X. If you change employers, you may need a new Corporate CLA from your new employer.

### Q: What if I disagree with how my contribution is used commercially?

**A:** By signing this CLA, you're agreeing to allow commercial use. If you're not comfortable with that, you should not contribute. However, remember that your contribution remains open source under AGPL, benefiting the community regardless of commercial use.
