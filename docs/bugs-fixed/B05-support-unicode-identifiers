should the utlx parser support unicode identifiers? Is it a bug? 

⏺ Yes, this is likely a bug/limitation that should be fixed. Here's the reasoning:

  JSON Standard (RFC 8259): JSON explicitly supports Unicode strings as object keys. Properties like "år", "løn", "satıcı" are valid JSON.

  Industry Practice: Most transformation and query languages support Unicode identifiers:
  - JavaScript/ECMAScript: Full Unicode identifier support
  - Python: Unicode identifiers (PEP 3131)
  - XPath/XSLT: Unicode in names
  - JSONPath: Operates on valid JSON, so should handle Unicode keys
  - jq: Supports Unicode property names

  UTL-X's Purpose: As a transformation language designed to work with JSON and XML from international sources (Swedish bank statements, Danish contracts, Turkish invoices), it should be able to access all valid JSON properties.

  The Fix: The lexer likely only recognizes ASCII [a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]* as valid identifiers. It should follow Unicode Standard Annex #31 (Unicode Identifier and Pattern Syntax) or at minimum allow Unicode letters in identifiers.
