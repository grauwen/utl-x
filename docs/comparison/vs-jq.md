## Comparison: UTL-X vs jq

Here’s a comprehensive comparison of these two data transformation tools:

### *Core Purpose*

*UTL-X* is a modern transformation language that works with XML, JSON, CSV, YAML, and other formats , designed for format-agnostic data transformation where you write transformation logic once and apply it to any supported format.

*jq* is a lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor akin to sed, awk, grep, and friends for JSON data  , specifically focused on JSON manipulation.

### *Key Differences*

|Feature           |UTL-X                                                                |jq                             |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
|*Format Support*|XML, JSON, CSV, YAML, and other formats                              |JSON only                      |
|*Maturity*      |Beta (v0.9.0, targeting v1.0 in December 2025)                       |Stable (v1.7.1 released)       |
|*Language*      |Written in portable C with zero runtime dependencies                 |Written in C, zero dependencies|
|*License*       |AGPL-3.0 (copyleft, requires source disclosure for network services) |MIT (permissive)               |
|*Type System*   |Strongly typed with compile-time error checking                      |Dynamically typed              |
|*Runtimes*      |JVM, JavaScript, Native (in development)                             |Single native binary           |

### *Syntax Comparison*

*UTL-X* uses a declarative syntax with explicit input/output format declarations:

⁠ utlx
%utlx 1.0
input json
output json
---
{
  items: input.data |> filter(item => item.price > 100)
}
 ⁠

*jq* uses a more concise filter-based approach:

⁠ bash
jq '.data | map(select(.price > 100))'
 ⁠

### *Strengths*

*UTL-X:*

•⁠  ⁠Format agnostic - one transformation works with XML, JSON, CSV, YAML 
•⁠  ⁠Functional and declarative with clean, maintainable transformation logic 
•⁠  ⁠Template matching similar to XSLT 
•⁠  ⁠Type safety catches errors early
•⁠  ⁠Good for complex multi-format ETL pipelines

*jq:*

•⁠  ⁠Portable C with zero runtime dependencies, single binary deployment 
•⁠  ⁠Battle-tested and widely adopted
•⁠  ⁠Extensive built-in functions for JSON processing 
•⁠  ⁠Excellent for shell scripting and command-line JSON manipulation
•⁠  ⁠Massive community and ecosystem

### *Use Case Recommendations*

*Choose UTL-X if you:*

•⁠  ⁠Need to work with multiple data formats (XML, JSON, CSV, YAML)
•⁠  ⁠Want format-agnostic transformations
•⁠  ⁠Need strong typing and compile-time validation
•⁠  ⁠Are building ETL pipelines or data migration tools
•⁠  ⁠Don’t mind using a newer, less mature tool

*Choose jq if you:*

•⁠  ⁠Only work with JSON
•⁠  ⁠Need a mature, production-ready tool
•⁠  ⁠Want the simplest installation (single binary)
•⁠  ⁠Need extensive community support and resources
•⁠  ⁠Prefer a permissive (MIT) license
•⁠  ⁠Need maximum stability and reliability

### *Bottom Line*

jq is the established standard for JSON processing with a mature ecosystem, while UTL-X is an ambitious newer project offering format flexibility at the cost of maturity. For pure JSON work, jq is the safer choice. For multi-format transformation needs, UTL-X’s format-agnostic approach is compelling—if you’re comfortable with beta software.
