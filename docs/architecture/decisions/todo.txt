See https://github.com/grauwen/utl-x/blob/main/docs/architecture/decisions/xsd-discussions-style.md ; the generation of an XSD for the output has to be in a default style and potentially might need configuration to choose the XSD style. 
In the analysis mode there should be more complex logic for nested XSD's and potentially a test for:  --Element Declaration [Local|Global] --Type Declaration [Local|Global]

SLF4J: Failed to load class "org.slf4j.impl.StaticLoggerBinder".

  This appears to be a runtime linkage issue between the CLI and stdlib that needs investigation beyond the scope of the current session.

Missing function: daysBetween not implemented in stdlib
The parser doesn't support if expressions with braces { } inside function bodies!

hasKey has two entries (one from the @UTLXFunction annotation in ObjectFunctions.kt, and one as an alias to containsKey). This is a minor duplicate that could be cleaned up later by removing the duplicate implementation.

⏺ Found the parser bug! let...in followed by inline if/else doesn't parse correctly. This is a parser limitation. Since I can't fix the parser easily, let me restructure the functions to avoid this pattern by using nested lets:

The test failure (expected: <IDENTIFIER> but was: <INPUT>) is unrelated to the new token types - it's a pre-existing issue where the test expects "input" to be an identifier, but it's defined as a 
keyword.

xml_namespace_handling test uses wildcard selectors (*[0]) which aren't supported by the current parser. This would require parser enhancements. Let me skip this for now and move to the next failure:

  Parser Limitations (3):
  - xml_namespace_handling - wildcard selectors *[0] not supported
  - yaml_config_processing - complex let bindings with array indexing
  - financial_data_processing - expression evaluation issue

BUGS

The XML serializer expects attributes to be in udm.attributes, but there's no syntax to create attributes from transformations. The @id: value syntax isn't implemented in the parser yet.

tests/examples/basic/json_to_xml_conversion.yaml
These tests use unimplemented syntax features.

log4j alike capabilities?

To unblock the 5 remaining function-related tests, we need to implement let ... in expressions:

  let variable = expression in body

  This is a scoped let binding where the variable is only available within the body expression.

  Would you like me to:
  1. Implement let ... in expressions to fix the remaining 5 tests?
  2. Continue with other grammar gaps (match expressions, try-catch, ternary operator)?
  3. Focus on fixing the other failing tests first?

The cleanest approach is to desugar them to lambda applications during parsing:

  let x = value in body → ((x) => body)(value)

  This automatically creates the proper scoping without AST changes:


REPL
$ utlx repl
  utlx> filter([1,2,3,4,5], x => x % 2 == 0)
  [2, 4]
Future improvements could include:
  - Command history (arrow keys)
  - Tab completion
  - Syntax highlighting
  - Multi-line input
  - Session save/load
  - Auto-save history

This inconsistency suggests that:
  - Some functions were designed to take List<UDM> directly (proper design)
  - Some functions were designed to take individual parameters and need adapters (inconsistent design)
