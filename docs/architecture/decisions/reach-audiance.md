Strategic approach to reach a large audience:

## *1. Developer Community Platforms*

*Reddit*

•⁠  ⁠r/programming (timing is key - post when you have a compelling story/milestone)
•⁠  ⁠r/devops, r/ETL, r/dataengineering (more targeted)
•⁠  ⁠r/selfhosted, r/opensource
•⁠  ⁠Be authentic, focus on solving problems, not just promoting

*Hacker News*

•⁠  ⁠Show HN posts work well for tools like this
•⁠  ⁠Best times: Tuesday-Thursday, 8-10 AM EST
•⁠  ⁠Title matters enormously - focus on the unique value prop
•⁠  ⁠Example: “Show HN: UTL-X – Transform XML/JSON/CSV with the same code”
•⁠  ⁠Engage genuinely in comments

*Dev.to & Hashnode*

•⁠  ⁠Write tutorials and use cases
•⁠  ⁠“How I replaced 5 different tools with one transformation language”
•⁠  ⁠“Converting legacy XML to JSON at scale”

## *2. Technical Content Marketing*

*Comparison Content*

•⁠  ⁠“UTL-X vs XSLT vs jq vs DataWeave” (what you’re already thinking about)
•⁠  ⁠Real benchmarks and honest trade-offs build trust
•⁠  ⁠SEO goldmine for people searching alternatives

*Problem-Focused Tutorials*

•⁠  ⁠“Migrating 10 years of XML data to JSON”
•⁠  ⁠“Building a multi-format API gateway”
•⁠  ⁠“ETL pipelines without vendor lock-in”

*Video Content*

•⁠  ⁠YouTube tutorials and demos
•⁠  ⁠Short TikTok/YouTube Shorts showing transformations
•⁠  ⁠Live coding sessions on Twitch

## *3. Strategic Positioning*

*Your Unique Angle*

•⁠  ⁠“XSLT for the modern age” - captures familiar concept
•⁠  ⁠“Format-agnostic transformations” - unique selling point
•⁠  ⁠“Open source alternative to DataWeave/Mule” - captures search traffic

*Target Pain Points*

•⁠  ⁠Vendor lock-in (huge concern in enterprise)
•⁠  ⁠Companies using multiple transformation tools
•⁠  ⁠Legacy XML modernization projects
•⁠  ⁠API integration headaches

## *4. Community Building*

*Early Adopters*

•⁠  ⁠Reach out to data engineering influencers
•⁠  ⁠Offer to solve real problems for companies
•⁠  ⁠Case studies are invaluable

*Documentation as Marketing*

•⁠  ⁠Your docs already look good - keep investing here
•⁠  ⁠Interactive playground on your website (try it without installing)
•⁠  ⁠Comparison guides showing migration from other tools

*Discord/Community*

•⁠  ⁠You mentioned Discord - make it active and welcoming
•⁠  ⁠Weekly office hours or AMA sessions
•⁠  ⁠Showcase community projects

## *5. Ecosystem Integration*

*Package Managers* (already doing this - great!)

•⁠  ⁠Homebrew ✓
•⁠  ⁠npm/npx for JavaScript runtime
•⁠  ⁠Docker images
•⁠  ⁠GitHub Actions marketplace

*IDE Extensions*

•⁠  ⁠VS Code extension for syntax highlighting
•⁠  ⁠LSP (Language Server Protocol) support
•⁠  ⁠Makes adoption much easier

*Integration Examples*

•⁠  ⁠GitHub Actions workflows
•⁠  ⁠GitLab CI examples
•⁠  ⁠Jenkins pipelines
•⁠  ⁠Apache Airflow operators

## *6. Strategic Outreach*

*Podcasts*

•⁠  ⁠Software Engineering Daily
•⁠  ⁠The Changelog
•⁠  ⁠Developer Tea
•⁠  ⁠CoRecursive (loves language design stories)

*Conferences*

•⁠  ⁠FOSDEM (free, huge reach)
•⁠  ⁠Local meetups and user groups
•⁠  ⁠DevOps conferences
•⁠  ⁠Data engineering summits

*Tech Media*

•⁠  ⁠InfoQ, The New Stack
•⁠  ⁠DZone, Medium publications
•⁠  ⁠Console.dev newsletter (features interesting dev tools)

## *7. Product Hunt & Launch Platforms*

*Timing*

•⁠  ⁠Wait for v1.0 for maximum impact
•⁠  ⁠Tuesday-Thursday launches perform best
•⁠  ⁠Have comparison docs, tutorials, and playground ready

*Preparation*

•⁠  ⁠Build email list beforehand
•⁠  ⁠Prepare launch assets (video demo, screenshots)
•⁠  ⁠Line up supporters to upvote/comment early

## *8. The DataWeave Angle*

This could be huge - DataWeave has users frustrated by:

•⁠  ⁠MuleSoft licensing costs
•⁠  ⁠Vendor lock-in
•⁠  ⁠Limited runtime options

*Strategy:*

•⁠  ⁠“Migrating from DataWeave to UTL-X” guide
•⁠  ⁠Feature comparison matrix
•⁠  ⁠Cost analysis (free vs enterprise licenses)
•⁠  ⁠Don’t bash them - focus on your benefits

## *9. SEO & Discoverability*

*Target Keywords*

•⁠  ⁠“XML to JSON converter”
•⁠  ⁠“data transformation language”
•⁠  ⁠“XSLT alternative”
•⁠  ⁠“open source DataWeave”
•⁠  ⁠“format agnostic transformation”

*Content Ideas*

•⁠  ⁠“10 ways to transform XML to JSON” (then show UTL-X)
•⁠  ⁠“Data transformation tools comparison 2025”
•⁠  ⁠Problem-solution blog posts

## *10. Quick Wins*

*This Week:*

•⁠  ⁠Post to r/programming with a compelling demo
•⁠  ⁠Submit to Console.dev weekly newsletter
•⁠  ⁠Write a “Why I built this” post on [Dev.to](http://Dev.to)

*This Month:*

•⁠  ⁠Show HN launch
•⁠  ⁠Create interactive playground
•⁠  ⁠First comparison guide (vs jq is perfect)
•⁠  ⁠Reach out to 5 data engineering influencers

*Before v1.0:*

•⁠  ⁠10+ tutorial blog posts
•⁠  ⁠YouTube channel with demos
•⁠  ⁠VS Code extension
•⁠  ⁠3 case studies

## *Crucial: The Story*

People connect with stories. Share:

•⁠  ⁠Why you built this (frustrations with existing tools)
•⁠  ⁠The journey (challenges, decisions, tradeoffs)
•⁠  ⁠Your vision (format-agnostic future)
•⁠  ⁠Real problems you’ve solved

The AGPL-3.0 choice is interesting - it differentiates you from proprietary alternatives but might concern some enterprises. Be ready to explain this clearly and consider offering commercial licensing if there’s demand.

*What’s your current biggest challenge?* User acquisition, technical development, or something else? I can dive deeper into any of these areas.
