Should You Package It with Theia?

  YES! Here are your options:

  Option 1: Bundle in Theia Application (Recommended)

  Modify: /Users/magr/data/mapping/github-git/utl-x/theia-extension/browser-app/package.json

  Add the extension as a dependency:
  {
    "dependencies": {
      "@theia/core": "1.64.0",
      "@theia/editor": "1.64.0",
      // ... other deps
      "utlx-language-support": "file:../../vscode-extension"
    }
  }

  Then Theia will automatically load it on startup.

  Option 2: Install Extension in Theia Plugins Directory

  Copy to Theia's extension folder:
  mkdir -p ~/.theia/extensions
  cp vscode-extension/utlx-language-support-1.0.0.vsix ~/.theia/extensions/

  Theia will auto-load it from there.

  Option 3: Deploy with Theia Application

  Add to your Theia deployment:
  # In your deployment script
  cp utlx-language-support-1.0.0.vsix $THEIA_PLUGINS_DIR/
