### [Dollar Sign ($) Input Prefix Migration](./dollar-sign-input-prefix-migration.md)

**Status:** Draft (2025-10-24)
**Target Version:** v2.0
**Type:** Breaking Change

Proposes migrating from `@` to `$` for input references to eliminate ambiguity with XML attributes and align with industry standards (XSLT, XPath, JSONata, JQ).

**Key Documents:**
1. **[Full Proposal](./dollar-sign-input-prefix-migration.md)** - Complete specification, rationale, implementation plan
2. **[Quick Reference](./at-vs-dollar-quick-reference.md)** - Side-by-side comparison and migration guide
3. **[GitHub Issue Template](./MIGRATION-ISSUE-TEMPLATE.md)** - For tracking implementation
4. **[Migration Script](../../scripts/migrate-at-to-dollar.sh)** - Automated migration tool

**Summary:**

Current (confusing):
```utlx
$orders.Order[0].@id
  ‚Üë              ‚Üë
  input          attribute
  (same symbol!)
```

Proposed (clear):
```utlx
$orders.Order[0].@id
 ‚Üë              ‚Üë
 input          attribute
 (different symbols!)
```

**Impact:**
- ‚úÖ Eliminates ambiguity
- ‚úÖ Industry standard alignment
- ‚úÖ Improved readability
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking change (v2.0)
- üîß Automated migration available

**Next Steps:**
1. Review and approve proposal
2. Implement parser changes (v1.5)
3. Create migration tooling (v1.5)
4. 6-month deprecation period
5. Breaking change release (v2.0)
