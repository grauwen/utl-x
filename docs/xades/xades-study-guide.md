## Core Concepts

### Digital Signatures Fundamentals

XAdES builds upon fundamental cryptographic concepts:

**Hash Functions**: Create a fixed-size digest of the document content, ensuring that any modification to the document can be detected.

**Public Key Cryptography**: Uses asymmetric key pairs (private key for signing, public key for verification) to create and verify signatures.

**Certificates**: X.509 digital certificates bind public keys to identities and are issued by trusted Certificate Authorities (CAs).

**Certificate Chains**: Establish trust through a chain from the signer's certificate up to a trusted root CA.

### XML-DSig Foundation

XAdES extends XML-DSig, which provides:

- Syntax for representing digital signatures in XML
- Methods for referencing data to be signed
- Algorithms for cryptographic operations
- Canonicalization of XML for consistent signing

**Key XML-DSig Elements:**
- `<Signature>`: Root element containing all signature information
- `<SignedInfo>`: Information that is actually signed
- `<SignatureValue>`: The encrypted hash value
- `<KeyInfo>`: Information about the signing key
- `<Object>`: Optional container for signed data or metadata

### XAdES Extensions

XAdES adds crucial elements for advanced signature features:

**Signed Properties**: Information that is covered by the signature, including:
- Signing time
- Signing certificate reference
- Commitment type indication
- Signer location
- Claimed roles

**Unsigned Properties**: Information added after signing, including:
- Time-stamps
- Certificate validation data
- Archival information
- Counter-signatures

## XAdES Architecture

### Structural Overview

XAdES signatures consist of a hierarchical structure built on XML-DSig:

```
XAdES Signature
│
├── XML-DSig Components
│   ├── SignedInfo
│   ├── SignatureValue
│   ├── KeyInfo
│   └── Object
│
└── XAdES Components
    ├── QualifyingProperties
    │   ├── SignedProperties
    │   │   ├── SignedSignatureProperties
    │   │   └── SignedDataObjectProperties
    │   │
    │   └── UnsignedProperties
    │       ├── UnsignedSignatureProperties
    │       └── UnsignedDataObjectProperties
```

### QualifyingProperties

The `<QualifyingProperties>` element is the central addition of XAdES to XML-DSig. It contains two main sections:

**SignedProperties**: Properties covered by the signature itself. These must be present at signing time and cannot be modified without invalidating the signature.

**UnsignedProperties**: Properties added after the signature is created, such as time-stamps and validation data. These can be added incrementally without invalidating the original signature.

### Namespace and Schema

XAdES uses specific XML namespaces:

- XAdES 1.3.2: `http://uri.etsi.org/01903/v1.3.2#`
- XAdES 1.4.1: `http://uri.etsi.org/01903/v1.4.1#`

The schema defines all XAdES-specific elements, attributes, and their relationships.

## XAdES Forms and Levels

XAdES defines multiple signature forms, each building upon the previous with additional features for long-term validity.

### XAdES-BES (Basic Electronic Signature)

The foundational XAdES form that includes:

- XML-DSig signature
- SignedProperties with basic qualifying information
- Signing certificate reference
- Signing time

**Minimum Requirements:**
- `<SigningTime>`: When the signature was created
- `<SigningCertificate>` or `<SigningCertificateV2>`: Reference to the signer's certificate
- `<SignaturePolicyIdentifier>`: Optional policy governing the signature

**Use Case**: Short-term signatures where certificate validity can be verified during the document's useful lifetime.

### XAdES-EPES (Explicit Policy Electronic Signature)

Extends XAdES-BES by explicitly referencing a signature policy:

- All XAdES-BES components
- Mandatory signature policy identifier
- Optional policy qualifiers

**Key Feature**: The signature policy defines the rules and requirements under which the signature was created, making it suitable for specific business or legal contexts.

**Use Case**: Environments requiring compliance with specific signature policies or business rules.

### XAdES-T (Electronic Signature with Time)

Adds a trusted time-stamp to establish the signature's existence at a specific time:

- All XAdES-BES or XAdES-EPES components
- SignatureTimeStamp (in UnsignedSignatureProperties)

**Time-Stamp Purpose:**
- Proves signature existed before a certain time
- Protects against key compromise after signature creation
- Provides evidence if signing certificate expires

**Use Case**: Signatures requiring proof of creation time and protection beyond certificate validity period.

### XAdES-C (Electronic Signature with Complete validation data)

Includes complete validation data for the signature:

- All XAdES-T components
- CompleteCertificateRefs: References to certificates in the certification path
- CompleteRevocationRefs: References to revocation data (CRLs/OCSP responses)

**Validation Data**: Allows verification of the certification path and revocation status at the time of signing.

**Use Case**: Signatures requiring comprehensive validation data for future verification when original validation sources may be unavailable.

### XAdES-X (eXtended Electronic Signature)

Protects the validation data with additional time-stamps:

**XAdES-X Type 1**: Time-stamps individual references
- SigAndRefsTimeStamp: Covers signature value and validation references

**XAdES-X Type 2**: Time-stamps the complete validation data
- RefsOnlyTimeStamp: Covers only the validation references

**Protection Mechanism**: Time-stamps prevent backdating of validation data and ensure its integrity.

**Use Case**: Long-term signatures where validation data must be protected against later manipulation.

### XAdES-X-L (eXtended Long-term Electronic Signature)

Embeds the actual validation data (not just references):

- All XAdES-X components
- CertificateValues: Complete certificates in the certification path
- RevocationValues: Complete revocation information (CRLs, OCSP responses)

**Self-Contained**: The signature contains all necessary data for validation without external queries.

**Use Case**: Archival signatures that must remain verifiable even if original validation services become unavailable.

### XAdES-A (Archival Electronic Signature)

Provides indefinite long-term validity through periodic re-timestamping:

- All XAdES-X-L components
- ArchiveTimeStamp: Protects all signature components
- Can be extended with additional ArchiveTimeStamps over time

**Long-Term Strategy**: As cryptographic algorithms weaken, new time-stamps with stronger algorithms can be added, creating a chain of trust extending signature validity indefinitely.

**Use Case**: Documents requiring archival for decades where signature validity must be maintained beyond the lifetime of original cryptographic algorithms.

### XAdES Baseline Profiles

The ETSI EN 319 132 standard defines simplified baseline profiles:

**XAdES-B-B (Baseline Basic)**: Equivalent to XAdES-BES/EPES with modernized requirements

**XAdES-B-T (Baseline with Time-stamp)**: Equivalent to XAdES-T

**XAdES-B-LT (Baseline Long-Term)**: Combines features of XAdES-X-L for long-term validation

**XAdES-B-LTA (Baseline Long-Term with Archive)**: Equivalent to XAdES-A with periodic re-timestamping

## Validation Process

### Basic Validation Steps

Validating a XAdES signature involves multiple checks:

1. **Signature Verification**
   - Extract SignedInfo and SignatureValue
   - Compute digest of SignedInfo using specified algorithm
   - Decrypt SignatureValue using signer's public key
   - Compare computed and decrypted digests

2. **Reference Validation**
   - For each Reference in SignedInfo
   - Retrieve referenced data
   - Apply transforms as specified
   - Compute digest and compare with DigestValue in Reference

3. **Certificate Validation**
   - Extract signing certificate from signature or KeyInfo
   - Verify certificate chain to trusted root
   - Check certificate validity period
   - Verify certificate has not been revoked

4. **SignedProperties Validation**
   - Verify SignedProperties are properly referenced in SignedInfo
   - Check SigningCertificate matches actual signing certificate
   - Validate signature policy if applicable

### Extended Validation for Advanced Forms

**XAdES-T Validation:**
- Verify SignatureTimeStamp
- Check time-stamp certificate validity
- Ensure signature existed before certificate expiration

**XAdES-C Validation:**
- Validate all certificate references
- Verify revocation references point to valid revocation data
- Ensure complete certification path is documented

**XAdES-X Validation:**
- Verify SigAndRefsTimeStamp or RefsOnlyTimeStamp
- Ensure validation data hasn't been tampered with
- Check time-stamp certificate validity

**XAdES-X-L Validation:**
- Verify embedded certificates match certificate references
- Validate embedded revocation data
- Ensure all validation material is internally consistent

**XAdES-A Validation:**
- Verify all ArchiveTimeStamps
- Check chronological order of time-stamps
- Validate entire signature package integrity

### Validation Context

Effective validation requires establishing a validation context:

**Time of Validation**: Current time or historical time for which validation is performed.

**Trust Anchors**: Set of trusted root certificates and TSA certificates.

**Revocation Data Sources**: Access to current CRLs and OCSP responders (or embedded data for X-L and A forms).

**Signature Policy**: If applicable, the policy document governing signature requirements.

**Acceptable Algorithms**: List of cryptographically acceptable algorithms at validation time.

### Validation Outcomes

Validation can result in different outcomes:

**Valid**: All checks passed, signature is cryptographically valid and satisfies all requirements.

**Invalid**: Signature verification failed or critical checks did not pass.

**Indeterminate**: Unable to conclusively determine validity (e.g., missing revocation data).

**Inconclusive**: Some checks passed but others could not be performed.

Detailed validation reports should specify which checks were performed and their individual outcomes.
